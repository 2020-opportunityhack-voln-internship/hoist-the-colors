## General info
Non-profits need a way to vet the standing of people, specifically for pets, as they want to be sure they are going to a nice home. Given a social media profile (and potentially their network) that someone has granted access to, analyze the content of their posts to create a risk score to understand if there are any red flags for pet adoption.
